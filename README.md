Bloom is a lightweight javascript UI library built on top of jQuery and MetaHub.  It is designed to build dynamic interfaces out of html building blocks.  It's terminology is built around gardening metaphors.

The primary class in Bloom is the Flower.  You grow multiple flowers to make your garden.  Each Flower wraps around a jQuery object using its element property.

flower.element = $('div');

Normally the flower's element is assigned when the flower is created.
